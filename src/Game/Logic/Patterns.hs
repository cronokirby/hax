Description: Describes timelines of events and bullets.

This module contains the logic necessary to be able to describe 
animations and more generally, timelines of events. It uses these
concepts to then talk about patterns of bullet fire.

{- TimeLines -}

This is usually constructed via the other timeline types.
-}
newtype TimeLine a = TimeLine { stepTimeLine :: Double -> (TimeLine a, Maybe a) } 


{- | Represents a time line of actions that ocurr once.

When converted to a timeline, no actions will fire after
the end of the list of events is reached.
-}

        in if now >= trigger
            then (nextWith restEvents, Just event)
            else (nextWith allEvents, Nothing)

{- | Make a timeline that runs a list of events a single time.

>>> (newTl, event) = stepTimeLine tl 2.0

{- | Makes a timeline that repeats a series of events.

Note that with the way this timeline works, once the end of the list
of events is reached, it takes one more step to reset the timeline.
This should have no effect on things, since timeSteps are so small.
This would lead to noticeable choppiness if timeSteps were on the order
of a second or so, but at that point, all the graphics would go to hell.

>>> tl = makeTimeLineRepeat [(1.0, "Hello")]
>>> (tl2, event) = stepTimeLine tl 2.0
>>> event
Just "Hello"
>>> (tl3, event) = (stepTimeLine tl2 2.0)
>>> event
Nothing
>>> snd (stepTimeLine tl3 2.0)
Just "Hello"

Look and Spinning are excluded because those can be
applied independent of where a bullet is going.

{- | Evenly divide objects around a circle centered at a point.

This function produces unit vectors distributed counter clockwise,
at interval given by 2pi/spacing, with unit velocity

{- | Advances every position by dT * velocity.

This is useful for scaling out a pattern.

-}

{- | Scales every speed in a path by a factor.

By default, most combinators specifying the shape of some kind of Path
use a unit velocity, which isn't very fast at all. This allows speeding
up those velocities but preserving the direction of the velocities.

>>> scaleVelocity 32 (divide 1 (position 0 0))
Path [(Position (V2 1.0 0.0),Velocity (V2 32.0 0.0))]

bullets are correctly deleted.
